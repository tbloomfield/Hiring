 * 528. Random pick with weight
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/
 * 
 * You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes
 * the weight of the ith index.
 * 
 * You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index
 * in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of
 * picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).
 * 
 * AKA sample from the array with weight. If we just randomly pick an element,
 * the probability that a number got picked is proportional to the number of other numbers.
 * If we
