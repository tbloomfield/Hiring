/**
 * 973. K Closest Points to Origin
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/
 * 
 * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
 * return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
 * 
 * Answer:
 *  * Since this is a (K) closest/smallest/biggest problems, we use a Priority Queue; since we want 
 *  points closest based on eucludian distance, we will use a max heap where distances furthest
 *  away can easily be popped and removed.
 * 
 * Priority Queue: O(n log k) - PQ is O(log n) insertion, and we loop through all (n) points, so this is O(n log k)
 * Storage: O(k+1) since we only store up to (k) elements.
 *
